# Office Hours

Office hours are generally from 6 to 8pm two days a week, always held in the student work area on the 8th floor. Two instructors will be present. They're completely optional, but can be extremely useful!

The format is informal: the instructors "on duty" hang out by the student work area, and if you get stuck, you can wander over and ask them a question, following the [guidelines on asking for help](asking-for-help.md). If everyone's having the same problem, the instructors may conduct an informal mini-lesson.
