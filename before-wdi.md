### Important!

**Please complete the following steps as soon as possible.** We can't make classroom/squad assignments until you do!

1. Click [this link](http://garnet.wdidc.org/github/authorize?invite_code=14b71bca6df0c463f47f6e03742141e2). This will authorize you for Garnet, an application that both instructors and students will use to track your progress throughout WDI.  

2. Update your GitHub profile with your full name and profile picture. The latter is very important - we need to know what you look like! The clearer the picture, the better.

3. **Important** Take the start of class survey - https://outcomes.generalassemb.ly/courses/14107/surveys/background/new
  - this allows us to collect emergency contact and food allergy information

Once you're done, we encourage you to take a look through [this readme](https://github.com/ga-dc/wdi8/blob/master/readme.md) if you would like to learn more about what you can expect out of WDI.

See you all Monday!
