# Asking For Help

## During Normal Weeks

Please make sure to read the [one-on-ones guidelines](one-on-ones.md)!

Outside of one-on-ones, you can always ask any instructor any question over the course of the day. If we're not around, please send one of us a Slack message -- we all live and breathe Slack!

We ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions, e.g. "Why isn't my code working?"

1. Try something else
2. Look at Google
3. Look at the [lesson plan](scope-and-sequence.md)
4. Ask another classmate
5. Ask an instructor

If we get the impression that you haven't tried the first three steps, we may push back and redirect you to Google, an article, or a lesson plan. It's not that we're mean or that we're too busy: We try hard to not just give anyone answers because that's not a sustainable approach to learning programming.

If it's clear that you've made a concerted effort to research the problem, then we'll be more than happy to help you figure things out. Usually the first question we'll ask is "What errors are you getting?"

If your question is **non-technical** -- you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt -- we'll do our best to address your concerns as quickly and thoroughly as possible.

**After 6pm**, aside from during [office hours](office-hours.md), instructors will *not* respond to *technical* questions. This is for our work-life balance as well as yours! If you have logistical questions, such as about a homework prompt or when class is starting, please contact **Adrian**. If you have other non-technical questions please contact your squad instructor, or if they're not available, any instructor.

## During Project Weeks

Instructors will be available in a Genius-Bar style format multiple times throughout the week.
Please refer to [the calendar](http://ga-dc.github.io/wdi8/calendar.html) to see which instructors will be available for support.

GitHub issues are also useful for answering technical questions. 90% of the time, at least one instructor will be dedicated to monitoring issues at all times during business hours. The other 10% will be announced in advance on Slack.

Issues should follow this format:
```
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.
My repo link is ___ and my question is about lines ___.
```

[Just click this handy link to create an issue with these blanks inserted for you!](https://github.com/ga-dc/project1/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.%0DMy+repo+link+is+___+and+my+question+is+about+lines+___.)

*Please close your issues when you've received a satisfactory answer*, and let us know what the solution was! We'll close issues that have gone more than 30 minutes without any updates.

**Note:** Issues can only be reopened by instructors. Therefore, should your issue get closed, please create a *new* issue, and if it's applicable to your previous issue, just include a link to the previous issue.

### Why?
Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

### How?
Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue. (You can also use the handy [template](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.%0DMy+repo+link+is+___+and+my+question+is+about+lines+___.) above.) It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help on Github.

#### Context
When submitting an issue, please provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What User Story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

#### Approaches Tried
Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

### Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

### So, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?
**We really want you talk to us when it's an emotional issue** more than a technical one.

For technical problems, seek us out in person when you've submitted an issue, and have spent more than 15 minutes trying to solve the problem yourself, 15 minutes Googling, and 15 minutes asking other students for help (in-person, on Slack, etc).
