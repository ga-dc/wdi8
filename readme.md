- Tips
  - \``hello`\`: Backtics (the top-left of the keyboard on a Mac) makes text show up in a monospace font. Great for code.
  - \`\`\`
    ```
    A row of 3 backtics on either end of text makes it show up as a block of monospaced code.

    The backtics must be on a row by themselves.
    ```
    \`\`\`
  - These same backtick tricks also work on **Github**.
